# Seat-Reservation-System
Bus Seat Reservation System is a Python-based console application developed during my B.Tech 1st year 1st term. It allows users to view seat availability, reserve and cancel seats, and calculate ticket prices with a family discount. The project uses lists, functions, loops, and conditions to simulate a real bus booking system.
